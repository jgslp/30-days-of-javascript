# 30 Days of JavaScript - Day 06

## Purpose
The purpose of these exercises was to get comfortable with using the different kinds of loops for different tasks.

### My thoughts
 I struggled with the prime number exercise as well as the exercise that required  generating random characaters. I still don't fully understand the prime number exercise, and had to look up the answer. Once I had a hint about how to solve the random characters items, however, I was able to solve all of those easily. I was already very comfortable with for loops, so the opportunity to get repeated practice using for...of loops was appreciated.
