## 30 Days of Javascript: Day 01

## Purpose
The purpose of this segment of 30 Days of Javascript was to:
- get introduced to Javascript
- install required programs
- practice declaring variables, checking data types, and printing to the console

### My thoughts
- I already had the needed programs installed on my computer, so I was able to skip the first steps. I was able to complete the exercises quickly, as I had completed similar exercises before. Rather than console logging in Google Chrome, I used Node. I found these exercises easy.
