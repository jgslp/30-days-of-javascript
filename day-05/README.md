# 30 Days of JavaScript Day 05

## Purpose
The purpose of these exercises was to practice creating and modifying arrays, using array methods, and looping through arrys. 

###Â My Thoughts
I found these exercises more challenging than the others; however, I was still able to complete it quite quickly. I skipped one exercise for time. I was happy that I was able to solve all exercises using methods and strategies that I already know. I had to look up the syntax for some of them, but I knew exactly what to look up.
