# 30 Days of Javascript - Day 03

## Purpose
The purpose of these exercises was to get acquainted with the Date Object, Window Methods, Booleans, and Operators. 

## My thoughts
- I found these exercises relatively simple. I am not sure whether my slope and x/y-intercept 
exercises are correct; I don't think I have reviewed these concepts since the sixth grade! 

- For the exercises requiring a prompt, I tried to make an initial condition that if the person did
not enter a number, an error message would print to the console using if (typeof variable !== 'number'); however this printed every time no matter whether I entered a number or not. So, I just left it out for now. 

- I was pleased to have completed the final exercise without googling; however I am sure there is 
a much more efficient way.
