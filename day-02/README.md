# 30 Days of JavaScript - Day02

## Purpose
The purpose of these exercises was to get comfortable: 
- declaring variables and assigning values
- altering the variables using methods like toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), trim(), split(), replace(), concat(), match()
- viewing properties of data using methods like .length, charAt(), charCodeAt(), indexOf, lastIndexOf, startsWith(), endsWith()

### My thoughts

I found all of these exercises quite easy except for #3 on the level 3 exercises.
I was able to clean the sentence and split the sentence into an array, but I do not know yet
how to find the most frequent item in the array. I found some resources online and attempted
them but did not fully understand it, so I skipped it for now.
